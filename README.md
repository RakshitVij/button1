# button1
Created these amazing buttons using HTML, CSS & JS. This CSS code defines a custom-styled button with a "glassy" or "frosted glass" effect. It uses CSS variables for flexibility and animations for smooth transitions.
In This Button Mini Project, I learnt:
Creating CSS custom properties (variables) declaration within the :root pseudo-class.
Where, :root Pseudo-class: is selector matching the root element of the document, which is usually the <html> element. It is used to define global CSS variables that can be accessed anywhere in the CSS file.
Applying Hover State, Active State, Focus Styles & Keyframes for animations.
